Numix-OSX
=========

A modified version of the Numix GTK theme modeled to look somewhat like OSX

Credit where credit is due: most of the theme comes from another 
modification of the [Numix project](http://www.numixproject.org) called 
["Numix-Blue-Remix"](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Numix+Blue+Remix?content=160634). 
I've changed the titlebar colors and changed the close/minimize/maximize 
buttons to look like OSX -- I got the inspriation from 
[this](http://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/221ebh/xubuntuxfce_inspired_by_norways_nice_weather/) 
and
